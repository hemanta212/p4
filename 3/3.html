                    <h1> Introduction </h1>
            <p>Bitcoin" is the first cyber or electronic currency operated without any intermediate body, central body or clearing house. Bitcoin is an electronic cash which allows users to use goods or services on the internet, such as acommon currency in the wick. Bitcoin is in the operating process and the software on softwares, which can be viewed and understood by its source code and architects.  Which country's gold, silver, multi-precious stones or foreign exchange or securities are kept safeguarding the amount to say, the amount in which the country is in practice is equal to the security of the Nepalese nation , but Bitcoin is an electronic currency that has no safety but it does not Mathematics is working as its foundation. </p>

                    <h1> History </h1>
            <p>The domain name "bitcoin.org" was registered on 18 August 2008. On 31 October 2008, a link to a paper authored bySatoshi Nakamoto titled Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System was posted to a cryptography mailing list. Nakamoto implemented the bitcoin software as open-source code and released it in January 2009. Nakamoto's identity remains unknown. On 3 January 2009, the bitcoin network was created when Nakamoto mined the first block of the chain, known as thegenesis block. Embedded in the coinbase of this block was the following text: "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks." This note has been interpreted as both a timestamp and a comment on the instability caused by fractional-reserve banking. The receiver of the first bitcoin transaction was cypherpunkHal Finney, who created the first reusable proof-of-worksystem (RPOW) in 2004. Finney downloaded the bitcoin software on its release date, and on 12 January 2009 received ten bitcoins from Nakamoto. Other early cypherpunk supporters were creators of bitcoin predecessors: Wei Dai, creator of b-money, and Nick Szabo, creator of bit gold. In 2010, the first known commercial transaction using bitcoin occurred when programmer Laszlo Hanyecz bought two Papa John's pizzas for 10,000 bitcoin.  Nakamoto is estimated to have mined one million bitcoins before disappearing in 2010, when he handed the network alert key and control of the code repository over to Gavin Andresen. Andresen later became lead developer at theBitcoin Foundation. Andresen then sought to decentralize control. This left opportunity for controversy to develop over the future development path of bitcoin. </p>

                    <h1> How it works </h1>
            <p>The bitcoin blockchain is a public ledger that records bitcoin transactions. It is implemented as a chain of blocks, each block containing a hash of the previous block up to the genesis block[a] of the chain. A network of communicating nodes running bitcoin software maintains the blockchain. Transactions of the form payer X sends Y bitcoins to payee Z are broadcast to this network using readily available software applications.  Network nodes can validate transactions, add them to their copy of the ledger, and then broadcast these ledger additions to other nodes. To achieve independent verification of the chain of ownership each network node stores its own copy of the blockchain. About every 10 minutes, a new group of accepted transactions, called a block, is created, added to the blockchain, and quickly published to all nodes, without requiring central oversight. This allows bitcoin software to determine when a particular bitcoin was spent, which is needed to prevent double-spending. A conventional ledger records the transfers of actual bills or promissory notes that exist apart from it, but the blockchain is the only place that bitcoins can be said to exist in the form of unspent outputs of transactions. </p>
