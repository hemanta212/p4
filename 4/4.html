                    <h1> Introduction </h1>
            <p>Given the bizarre character of black holes, it was long questioned whether such objects could actually exist in nature or whether they were merely pathological solutions to Einstein's equations. Einstein himself wrongly thought that black holes would not form, because he held that the angular momentum of collapsing particles would stabilize their motion at some radius. This led the general relativity community to dismiss all results to the contrary for many years. However, a minority of relativists continued to contend that black holes were physical objects, and by the end of the 1960s, they had persuaded the majority of researchers in the field that there is no obstacle to the formation of an event horizon.</p>

                    <h1> First Blackhole Image </h1>
            <p> At the center of Messier 87, a massive galaxy in the nearby Virgo galaxy cluster, exists a supermassive black hole. Dubbed M87, this all-consuming region of spacetime is located more than 55 million light-years from Earth and is estimated to have a light-sucking core 6.5 billion times the mass of the sun.  For the first time ever, as shown above, we finally have an "image" of this celestial monster.  "This is a huge day in astrophysics," NSF Director France Córdova said in a statement. "We're seeing the unseeable. Black holes have sparked imaginations for decades. They have exotic properties and are mysterious to us. Yet with more observations like this one they are yielding their secrets. This is why NSF exists. We enable scientists and engineers to illuminate the unknown, to reveal the subtle and complex majesty of our universe."  As Manchester University astronomer Tim Muxlow told The Guardian in 2017, the image captured isn't exactly a direct photo of a black hole as much as it's a picture of its shadow.  "It will be an image of its silhouette sliding against the background glow of radiation of the heart of the Milky Way," he said. "That photograph will reveal the contours of a black hole for the first time."  </p>
